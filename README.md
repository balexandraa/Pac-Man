# Pac-Man AI Project

This repository contains my solutions to the Pac-Man AI project from UC Berkeley, part of their introduction to artificial intelligence course. The project involves the use of search algorithms and multi-agent systems to control Pac-Man and interact with ghosts in a simulated environment.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Search Project**
In this part of the project, I implemented various search algorithms to help Pac-Man navigate the maze. The algorithms include:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **`A* Search`**
- **Greedy Best-First Search**
- **Uniform Cost Search**

### 2. **Multi-Agent System**
In the multi-agent system extension, I created agents for both Pac-Man and the ghosts. These agents interact and try to achieve their individual goals:
- **Pac-Man**: Collecting all the food pellets while avoiding the ghosts.
- **Ghosts**: Pursuing Pac-Man using strategies based on different algorithms.
